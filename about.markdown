My name is Berkeley Willis, and I am a Cybersecurity Engineer and Data Scientist. My background of cybersecurity work begins in my education at the University  of Memphis and work in the Center for Information Assurance lab under Dr. Dipankar Dastgupta. There I learned the basic cybersecurity basics, and honed many practical skills such as reverse engineering and digital forensics. There I worked on many projects dealing with educating entry level students and the general public on aspects of security that would be useful to them.

During my time at Discover's security department, I had begun processing and understanding larger and larger data sets, which is what lead me to learn about and study Data Science. I pursued my Master's in Data Science at Bellevue University, and learned a lot about the field and where it can possibly be applied in cybersecurity.

My time pursuing my Master's Degree is where this portfolio originated, much of my class work and projects are here. Thought it may not full show my software development skills, I think it does tell a story about how I've developed during my time at Bellevue with my Data Science skills. This isn't where my craving for learning and knowledge will stop though, this is likely just the beginning for me. I will continue to add, possibly migrate this to one of my primary GitHub accounts, but I will be adding more as I do my own security, software development, and data science projects.
