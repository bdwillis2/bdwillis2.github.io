# DSC530-T301 Term Project

## Exploring Patterns in YouTube Trending Videos

Purpose of this project is to explore YouTube trending statistical data for patterns and opportunities to create a basic prediction model. I started out wanting to be able predict or finding common things about videos that appear in a trending tab, but was limited in the data due to not having data from non-trending videos or even data from those videos that become trending videos outside of when they were in trending.

**Data Source**: https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/youtube-new

**Python Version**: 3.8.1

**Required Packages**

* numpy
* pandas
* pandarallel
* scipy
* matplotlib
* statsmodels

## Future works

If I am able to find a dataset that would allow it, I would like to do a survival analysis to predict how long a video would stay in the trending tab. What I would require is data on videos that appear in trending, and data from the same videos when they fall out of trending. That way I am able to mine out the deltas in changes of certain statistics between the videos at various points.
