# Cardio Vascular Statistics

This project for a Statistics class, a statistical analysis is run on cardio vascular data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/sulianova/cardiovascular-disease-dataset).

---

## Motivation

The goal of the project was to learn from the data that is available, what data points are the best to correlate them to cardio vascular disease. The idea is to figure out what might help create the best predictors from the data available, and see if a statistical model could be created to accurately predict the likelihood of the individual has a cardio vascular disease.

## How to run

Install the following libraries for R:
* ggplot2
* class
* dplyr
* e1071
* caret
* rmarkdown

After installing the libraries you only have to run the following
```R

```

The findings for my run are found in the repository [here](final_project_WillisBerkeley.docx).
